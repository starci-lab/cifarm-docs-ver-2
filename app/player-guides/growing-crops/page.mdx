## 1. Farm Mode

Welcome to **Farm Mode** in CiFarm, where you'll sow the seeds of your fortune! Players get to plant seeds across their land plots and watch them grow through various stages. When harvest season arrives, your hard work pays off with experience points and gold. This isn't just planting—it's a strategic game of **care and rewards**!

### Five Growth Stages of Seeds: Nurture to Prosper
Every seed in CiFarm evolves through **five distinct stages**. Your job is to **tend to them with water and pesticides** to unlock their full potential. Here's how it breaks down:

1. **Planting the Dream** 🌱
   - Drop your seed into the soil and watch the magic begin. **Patience is key** as it takes root and starts sprouting.

2 & 3. **Watering Watch** 💦
   - These stages are all about **TLC**. Your crops have a **50% chance** to need water when advancing to these stages. Check in regularly and give them a splash when needed. **Skip this, and they'll stall**—don't let your profits wither away!

4. **Battle the Odds** ⚔️
   - Things get challenging here. Your crops have a **100% chance** to become either **weedy or infested**. If you don't treat them, your yield will be **reduced by 50%**. Stay vigilant—this is where farmers earn their stripes!

5. **Harvest Glory** 🎉
   - The big payoff! Fully matured crops are ready to reap. **Harvest them for rewards**, but here's the twist:
     **Some plants are multi-season champs.** After you collect, they **bounce back to Phase 3**, setting you up for another round of riches!

### Rewards That Grow With You
Once you've harvested, **cash in your haul for gold and experience points**. Every crop sold fuels your rise—**stack that gold, climb the levels, and unlock new crops** from CiFarm's treasure chest. **The more you farm, the bigger the haul**, so keep planting, keep harvesting, and **watch your empire flourish!**

### Watering Can and Pesticides: Essential Tools
CiFarm provides you with **watering cans and pesticides**—your lifeline to bumper crops:

- **Watering Can** 💧: Use to water crops in **Phases 2 and 3** if they are thirsty.
- **Pesticide** 🐛: Use in **Phase 4** to treat crops that are **infested** (bug icon).
- **Herbicide** 🌱: Use in **Phase 4** to treat crops that are **weedy** (weed icon).

Your mission? **Wield these tools like a pro** to **squeeze every drop of productivity from your land**. **Timing's everything—farm smart, not hard!**

From **seeds to game-changing boosts**, every item is a **ticket to bigger harvests and fatter profits**.
